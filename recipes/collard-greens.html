    <div class="recipelist">This is an absolutely delicious and easy way to prepare a big batch of collard greens.
        It cooks in a crock pot, making it fast and simple. The taste is out of this world - sweet, tangy, smoky and savory. 
        I don't mind canned greens, but it's hard to go back after having these!
