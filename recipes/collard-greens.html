<p>This is an absolutely delicious and easy way to prepare a big batch of collard greens.
    It cooks in a crock pot, making it fast and simple. The taste is out of this world - sweet, tangy, smoky and savory. 
    I don't mind canned greens, but it's hard to go back after having these!

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>8 cups raw collard greens (2 large bunches)</li>
    <li>Ham hocks (2)</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Cook bacon. Reserve 2-3 tablespoons of the fat.</li>

</ol>
