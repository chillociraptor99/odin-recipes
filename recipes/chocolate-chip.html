<p>These are my absolute favorite chocolate chip cookies. 
    They always come out soft, chewy and comforting with slightly crisp edges. 
    They will look raw and wobbly when you pull them out - don't be put off! 
    This keeps them nice and soft for a few days after baking.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 large egg + 1 large egg yolk, at room temperature</li>
