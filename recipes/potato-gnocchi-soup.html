<p>This is a comforting, hearty dish that combines the flavors of a loaded baked potato with delicious gnocchi dumplings. 
    It's a favorite for bad weather days or the cold parts of the year (if you have those where you are - don't get many here.) 
    It will taste good on any day, though, if I'm being honest. A real potato lover's dream.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Russet potatoes (3 lbs)</li>
    <li>Sweet onion (1/2)</li>
    <li>Garlic (1 tbsp)</li>
    <li>Bacon (1 lb)</li>
    <li>Green onions (1 bunch)</li>
    <li>Milk (1 cup)</li>
    <li>Sharp cheddar cheese, shredded (1 cup)</li>
    <li>Sour cream (for garnish)</li>
    <li>Potato gnocchi (16 oz)</li>
    <li>Chicken stock (3 cups)</li>
</ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Set oven to 425 degrees fahrenheit. Set aside 2-3 strips of bacon, then lay the rest out on foil covered baking sheet or into cast iron skillet and put into oven. Set timer for 13-15 minutes.</li>
    <li>Dice up half of a sweet onion. The pieces should be small enough that several could fit onto a spoonful.</li>
    <li>Cut up green onions, separating whites and greens. Wash and peel potatoes. Cut into large chunks.</li>
    <li>Set instant pot to sautee. Add reserved strips of bacon to pot and cook until crisp. Remove bacon from instant pot.</li>
    <li>Add diced onions and whites of green onions directly into bacon fat. Sautee until translucent, then add garlic in and stir for a minute.</li>
    <li>Add in chicken stock, chunked potatoes, salt, pepper, and seasonings to taste if desired.</li>
    <li>Set instant pot to cook for 10 minutes at pressure.</li>
    <li>Remove cooked bacon when finished and crumble into bite sized pieces. Set aside.</li>
    <li>Slow release for 5 minutes, then release pressure. Stir in milk and gnocchi.</li>
    <li>Serve with cooked bacon, sour cream and diced green parts of green onions.</li>
