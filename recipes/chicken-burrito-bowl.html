<p>A household favorite lunch! These are easy to prep for in bulk, tasty and simple to make.
    I've included an optional sauce that goes well with these, but they are just as good without.
    Of course you can dress them up however you want. You can also turn them into burritos if you want.
    This recipe is meant to prepare a week's worth of bowls for two people.
